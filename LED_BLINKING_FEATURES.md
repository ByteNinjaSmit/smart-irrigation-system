# ESP8266 LED Blinking Features

## Overview
Added visual LED feedback to the ESP8266 built-in LED (blue) to indicate when manual control commands are received and executed from the frontend.

## LED Blinking Patterns

### ðŸ”µ **Pump Control Commands**
- **Pump ON**: 3 quick blinks (200ms each)
  - Indicates manual pump activation
  - Relay turns ON, pump starts
- **Pump OFF**: 2 slower blinks (300ms each)
  - Indicates manual pump deactivation
  - Relay turns OFF, pump stops

### ðŸ”µ **Auto Mode Commands**
- **Auto Mode ON**: 4 fast blinks (150ms each)
  - Indicates automatic irrigation enabled
  - System will now control pump automatically
- **Auto Mode OFF**: 1 long blink (500ms)
  - Indicates manual mode enabled
  - System requires manual pump control

### ðŸ”µ **Frontend Connection**
- **Data Request**: 2 quick blinks (100ms each)
  - Indicates frontend connected and requesting data
  - ESP8266 will send immediate sensor data

## Implementation Details

### Function Added
```cpp
void blinkLED(int times, int delayMs) {
  for (int i = 0; i < times; i++) {
    digitalWrite(LED_PIN, LOW);  // Turn LED ON (active LOW)
    delay(delayMs);
    digitalWrite(LED_PIN, HIGH); // Turn LED OFF
    delay(delayMs);
  }
}
```

### Command Integration
Each manual control command now includes LED feedback:

```cpp
if (command == "pump-on") {
  digitalWrite(RELAY_PIN, HIGH);
  pumpStatus = true;
  Serial.println("Pump turned ON manually");
  blinkLED(3, 200); // 3 blinks for pump ON
}
```

## Visual Feedback System

| Command | LED Pattern | Duration | Meaning |
|---------|-------------|----------|---------|
| `pump-on` | 3 blinks | 200ms each | Pump activated manually |
| `pump-off` | 2 blinks | 300ms each | Pump deactivated manually |
| `auto-on` | 4 blinks | 150ms each | Auto mode enabled |
| `auto-off` | 1 long blink | 500ms | Manual mode enabled |
| `frontend-connected` | 2 quick blinks | 100ms each | Data request received |

## Benefits

1. **Visual Confirmation**: Users can see on the ESP8266 that commands were received
2. **Command Differentiation**: Different blink patterns for different commands
3. **Real-time Feedback**: Immediate LED response when commands are executed
4. **Debugging Aid**: Helps troubleshoot communication between frontend and ESP8266
5. **User Experience**: Physical confirmation that the system is responding

## Usage
1. Open the frontend dashboard
2. Use the Control Panel buttons to send commands
3. Watch the ESP8266 built-in LED for visual confirmation
4. Different blink patterns indicate different command types

The LED will blink immediately when the ESP8266 receives and processes the command, providing instant visual feedback that the manual control is working correctly.
